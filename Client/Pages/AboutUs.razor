                We serve coffee from Coffee Growers Ltd.  and feature roasters from Europe and beyond, including Five Beans, Koppi Coffee, Coffee Collective, Drop Coffee and many more. The coffee menu is always changing for both espresso-based and filter coffees. From a fruity natural Ethiopian to a sweet washed Colombian, there’s something for everyone! We also love tea!
